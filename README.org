* Capistrano::Docker

Build and deploy docker images with capistrano.

** Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
  gem 'capistrano-docker',
    git: "https://github.com/goldstarlearning/capistrano-docker.git"
#+END_SRC

And then execute:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
bundle
#+END_SRC

** Usage

   Add this line to your capistrano configuration:

   #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
     require "capistrano/docker"
   #+END_SRC

*** Configuration Variables

    capistrano-docker uses these variables to name docker images and
    containers:

    #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
      set :organization, "orgname"
      set :application,  "myapp"
      set :branch, fetch(ENV["BRANCH"], `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`.rstrip)
    #+END_SRC

    Docker images will be named/tagged as:
        `organization/application:branch-SHA`

    Currently, the docker image is built on the primary server having
    the `build' role, then copied and installed on all servers with
    the `app' role.  Implying a stage set-up that includes something
    like the following:

    #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
      server ENV["APP_SERVER"],
             user: "deploy",
             roles: %w{app web}

      server ENV["BUILD_SERVER"],
             user: "deploy",
             roles: %w{build},
             primary: true
    #+END_SRC


*** Available Tasks

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    cd test-app && bundle exec cap -T docker
